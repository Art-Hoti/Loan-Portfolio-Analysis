## Description

The Loan Portfolio Analysis project aims to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a large financial institutionâ€™s loan portfolio. By analysing loan data, the project seeks to uncover patterns, relationships, and anomalies that will inform decisions regarding loan approvals, pricing, and risk management. The ultimate goal is to enhance the performance and profitability of the loan portfolio.

Key aspects of the project include:

- **Data Extraction**: Extracting loan data from a cloud database.
- **Data Loading**: Loading data into a Pandas DataFrame for analysis.
- **Data Analysis**: Investigating the dataset to understand its structure and characteristics.
