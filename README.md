## Description

The Loan Portfolio Analysis project aims to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a large financial institutionâ€™s loan portfolio.

Key aspects of the project include:

- **Data Extraction**: Extracting loan data from a cloud database.
- **Data Loading**: Loading data into a Pandas DataFrame for analysis.
- **Data Analysis**: Investigating the dataset to understand its structure and characteristics.
